# Diagnosing-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to diagnose Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on clinical and laboratory data. By leveraging various supervised learning algorithms, the model predicts CKD status with high accuracy, aiding in early detection and better patient management.
